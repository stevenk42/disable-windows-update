# disable-windows-update
Simple batch script to quickly disable windows update which I made for Windows 11.

Please view the batch script prior to running to confirm to yourself there is no malicious code present (there isn't, but it's always healthy to verify batch scripts before running). If you do not understand any portion of this script, or you do not know how to undo the changes, DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT. I will not be supporting you if you zap your system and didn't make a system restore.

I made this for my own use, but I know other people will find it useful as I tried searching for something like this myself and found nothing existed.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
